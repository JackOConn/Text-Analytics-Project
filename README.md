# Text Analytics Project

Team Members: Jack O'Connor

Description: This project creates train, validation, and test sets 
  to be used for the Naive Bayes, SVM, and Logistic Regression
  classifiers in order to create a prediction accuracy of >75%.
  
Materials: I downloaded 5 articles from each category (lyme disease, acute rheumatic arthritis, 
  cardiovascular abnormalities, and knee osteoarthritis) to use for my model.
